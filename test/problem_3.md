Add your answer to problem 3 below.

Video 1 - Trading Psychology:
    
    What I learned from this video is that FOMO isn't only applied to finance, rather can be applied to a range of 
    expirences, whether from work, social, or personal life. FOMO stands for Fear of Missing Out/Opportunities and is 
    defined as a type of anxiety. When appliying the counters of FOMO to computer science, I think of job opportunities 
    or career advancing conventions/events since I don't think someone can miss out on writing code. However, the 
    non-work aspects of FOMO still have a large impact on my preformance in future work, so being aware and knowing how
    to deal with those types of FOMO will benefit me in the long run.

Video 2 - TDD for those who don't need it:

    TDD stands for Test Driven Development. Usually, developers who use TDD use it as a way to keep track of code 
    robustness and as a way to improve code later on. However, this can and does create a stigma that if your code 
    doesn't pass your tests or have test to begin with, then you have written bad code. In other words, "untested code 
    is legacy code." The speaker of this video believes that this view of TDD makes code writing harder and more 
    stressful. The speaker instead proposes that test should serve as a starting ground and checklist for coders to know
    their goals, even if they need to pause for a while. In addition, this way of TDD allows new tests/requirements to 
    be integrated easier.

    What I have learned from this video is that the way I use my test cases has an impact on the quality of my code. If 
    my test cases are there to judge my initial code, then I may be more stressed towards fails. If my test cases serve 
    as checkpoints, then I'll feel more in control.
